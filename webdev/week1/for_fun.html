        <p>
         I work on lots of projects. Techs Studio has became a umbrila name to cover everything from a Ebay Store 
         to Google Play. The latest journey has been micro controlers and other random stuff.

        <h3>Arduino + MQ-4 + AirWick + Gas</h3>
        <p>This project started as a funny thought and turned out to be a really fun project. I have plans to 
            upgrade to wireless and adding a exchangable device. This could easily run a confettie cannon or air horn.
